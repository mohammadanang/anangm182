{{< figure class="avatar" src="/8413482.jpeg" alt="avatar" >}}

Hello! My name is `Mohammad Anang`.  
Typing is my daily activities. I can't live without typing.  
Sometimes thinking. Sometimes sleeping.  
Eyes up and down. Head left and right.  
No matter how tired I am. I will always typing.  
That's what people called a `Software Engineer`.
